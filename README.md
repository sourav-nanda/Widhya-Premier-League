WPL the abbreviation of Widhya Premier League is an internship program lasting from 10th Oct, 2020 to 10th Nov, 2020 for Data Science/Analytics enthusiasts in which people with the required skills can participate in irrespective of age. Throughout the internship we have been given 5 MCQs regularly on Widhya's website (widhya.org), the questions were related to IPL and to find the answers we needed to use 2 datasets available on Kaggle and finally after answering the questions we also needed to submit the whole approach of answering those MCQs and finally there was an optional choice of uploading the Python/R code ,Tableau File or Excel workbook which had the highest weightage. Overall it was a nice gamified experience with a leaderboard to rank everyone based on points and many incentives for newbies and seasoned alike to keep the morale high.
